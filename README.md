|<img src="figures/cdu.PNG"  width="600" />| **Code Compression** <br>*implementation of both code compression and decompression using  C++. Assume that the dictionary can have eight entries (index 3 bits) and the eight entries are selected based on frequency (the most frequent instruction should have index 000). If two entries have the same frequency, the priority should be given to the one that appears first in the original program order. The original code consists of 32-bit binaries. You are allowed to use only the given seven possible formats for compression. Note that if one entry (32-bit binary) can be compressed in more than one way, choose the most beneficial one i.e., the one that provides the shortest compressed pattern. If two formats produce exactly the same compression, choose the one that appears earlier in the given list (e.g., run-length encoding appears earlier than direct matching). Also, if there is a scenario where you have two possible ways of applying bitmasks to a 32-bit binary, always give preference to the scenario where the leftmost bit â€˜1â€™ for the bitmask pattern (e.g., 11 is preferred over 01). Please count the starting location of a mismatch from the leftmost (MSB) bit of the pattern â€“ If the mismatch is at the MSB, Mismatch Location should be 00000.* [[project]](Assignment%203%20Code%20Compression)|
