	How many input patterns (tests) are required (minimum) to verify a 3-input OR gate completely when only binary inputs are allowed (each input can be 0 or 1)? List the inputs and expected outputs.

	How many input patterns (tests) are required (minimum) to verify a 3-input OR gate completely when only ternary inputs are allowed (each input can be 0 or 1 or x;  x implies unknown which can be 0 or 1)? List the inputs.

	\section*{Problem 3 (2 Points)}
	
	There are two types of processor simulation techniques - functional and cycle-accurate. Given an input assembly program, the functional simulation produces the correct output but does not provide cycle-by-cycle  details. On  the  other  hand,  the  pipelined  simulation  provides  a cycle-by-cycle  simulation  of  the pipeline  to  eventually  produce  the  final  result. Which one  is  faster  in  terms  of  performance  (simulation time) and why? Why do people use the slower one, then?

	\section*{Problem 4 (2 Points)}
	
	There are only two ways of combining compression and encryption: 
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item CASE I: compression followed by encryption.
		\item CASE II: encryption followed by compression.
	\end{itemize}
	
	Please  indicate  which  is beneficial for both  code  size  reduction  and  security  improvement.  Please explain why the other one is not suitable.

	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Download the shadow.hex file from the ``assignment6-resources'' folder. This file has been encrypted using RC4 encryption. 40 bits hexadecimal key: \textcolor{magenta}{6D 69 74 72 65}. Decrypt the file using any available decryption tool (e.g., cryptool). Add a screenshot of the decrypted shadow.hex file content.

		\item Run ``John the Ripper'' password cracking utility to crack the passwords in the decrypted shadow file with the help of the dictionary ``rockyou.txt''(\href{https://uniofmora-my.sharepoint.com/:t:/g/personal/scharles_uom_lk/EQvMHge3CrZNpeE7WGXpapoBslFMMcgHih0teepNIwDVIg?e=9aEjJd}{Link}). What is the command you used to crack the passwords in the shadow file?\\		
		
		``\textit{Note that John can't crack hashes of different
			types at the same time.  If you happen to get a password file that has more than one hash type, you have to invoke John once for each hash type and you need to use this option to make John crack hashes of types other than the one it would auto-detect by default.}'' - abstracted from \href{https://github.com/openwall/john/blob/bleeding-jumbo/doc/OPTIONS}{here}.\\

		\textbf{Note}:  ``{\tt resources}'' in the following command is a user created directory to keep the password list and the decrypted shadow file.\\
	
		Therefore, following commands were invoked one after the other to crack all the possible passwords in the given shadow file.\\
		
		{\footnotesize \tt \$ ./john --wordlist=resources/rockyou.txt --rules resources/Cry-RC4-shadow.txt --format=md5crypt}\\
		{\footnotesize \tt \$ ./john --wordlist=resources/rockyou.txt --rules resources/Cry-RC4-shadow.txt --format=sha256crypt}\\

		It was observed that, the Estimated Time of Arrival(ETA) to crack the password of the \textit{root} is 2023-01-XX and its progress increment really slowly. Therefore the program was aborted without trying to crack it.
